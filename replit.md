# iTrack GPS Application

## Overview
iTrack is a professional enterprise GPS monitoring application for fleet management in Romania. It provides real-time GPS tracking, trip management, robust offline capabilities, and comprehensive analytics to optimize transport operations. The project's vision is to offer a reliable and efficient solution for vehicle tracking, supporting operational excellence and market potential in the transport industry.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Date format preference: DD-MM-YYYY (zi-luna-an) for Romanian locale.
Timestamp preference: Romania local time (+3 hours from UTC) for all GPS data and system timestamps.
Performance optimization: Universal optimization for ALL Android phones (not device-specific).
Code comments: All comments must be in Romanian language.
Backup files: Remove unnecessary backup files.
UI Performance: Remove heavy animations that may affect performance on Android devices.
Offline Coordinates Policy: NEVER clear offline coordinates at logout - preserve route continuity across login sessions to avoid missing road segments.
Code Cleanup: Comprehensive cleanup completed - removed unused files/services and functions.
GPS Background Fix: Restored direct Android GPS calls for background service with hybrid browser backup system to ensure GPS continues working when phone is locked/app minimized.
Real Device Data: Implemented dynamic battery level detection and real network type detection instead of static values, using Android native APIs, Capacitor Device/Network plugins, and browser APIs with intelligent fallbacks.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.6 with custom CSS featuring glassmorphism
- **Mobile Framework**: Capacitor 7.3.0 for native cross-platform deployment (primarily Android)

### Backend Integration
- **API Communication**: RESTful API integration
- **Authentication**: JWT token with automatic persistence
- **Data Format**: JSON

### Mobile Platform Integration
- **Primary Target**: Android with native GPS services
- **Cross-Platform**: Capacitor allows iOS deployment
- **Native Services**: Enhanced GPS tracking with continuous background operation, intelligent battery management via foreground service, and WakeLock implementation.
- **Permissions**: Location, background location, and exclusion from battery optimization.

### Core Features
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Secure email/password login, JWT token management, and secure logout.
- **Advanced GPS Tracking**: Native Android service for continuous background tracking (10-second interval), offline caching of coordinates with batch synchronization, and high-precision data. Includes adaptive intervals, foreground service priority, and Doze mode bypass. GPS continues for both active and paused courses.
- **Professional Trip Management**: Vehicle number input, loading of vehicle-specific trips, real-time status management (Available, Active, Pause, Stopped), and an optimized driver interface.
- **Enterprise Analytics**: Dedicated modals for detailed trip statistics (distance, time, speed) using the Haversine formula, and cumulative reports.
- **Advanced Debug Panel**: Accessible via 50 clicks on the timestamp, providing persistent logging (GPS, API, OFFLINE_SYNC, APP, ERROR categories) and export functions.
- **Robust Offline Management**: Automatic online/offline status detection, intelligent GPS coordinate caching, visual synchronization progress, automatic recovery, and retry logic for data transmission. Syncs in batches of 50 coordinates with chronological sorting.

### Technical Implementations
- **GPS Logic**: BackgroundGPSService runs persistently in the background with ScheduledExecutorService for reliable timing. Acquires WakeLock for deep sleep prevention, uses dedicated HandlerThread for GPS operations, and guaranteed execution through foreground service protection with HIGH priority notification.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Corporate design with glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and intuitive iconography. Responsive layouts with safe area padding. Optimized for zero-lag scrolling by eliminating `backdrop-filter`, `blur` effects, and `transform` properties. Cleaner interface without redundant GPS status indicators.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging, non-blocking GPS operations, graceful degradation for network issues, and clear user guidance for permissions.
- **Environment Management**: Centralized API_CONFIG system for easy environment switching (PROD/TEST/DEV) with automated build scripts.
- **HTTP Modernization**: Uses OkHttp + Volley dual-chain for reliable GPS transmission, now exclusively using CapacitorHttp native methods for all API calls in Android-only environment.

## External Dependencies

- **UI Libraries**: Bootstrap 5.3.6

## Recent Major Updates

### 2025-08-16: BackgroundGPSService Complete Migration & APK Generation SUCCESS
- **🔄 BACKGROUND GPS SERVICE MIGRATION**: COMPLETE replacement of SimpleGPSService with BackgroundGPSService for superior reliability. Handler system conflicts causing GPS stoppage after 1-2 transmissions completely resolved through ScheduledExecutorService implementation. New architecture uses TimeUnit.SECONDS timing, HandlerThread for GPS operations, and dedicated background thread execution.
- **📍 REAL GPS DATA CONFIRMED**: GPS transmits authentic sensor values: Lat: 44.2583161, Lng: 28.6174123, Altitude: 54.6m, Battery: 14%. Speed: 0, Direction: 0 (normal for stationary device). All values from real Android sensors, not hardcoded coordinates.
- **🛠️ ARCHITECTURAL SIMPLIFICATION**: Eliminated SimpleGPSService entirely - removed 912 lines of Handler-based code with dual-timing conflicts. BackgroundGPSService implements clean ScheduledExecutorService architecture with automatic timeout handling, Foreground Service priority, and WakeLock for phone-locked operation.
- **⚡ PRODUCTION RELIABILITY**: ScheduledExecutorService operates independently of MainLooper, preventing UI thread blocking. GPS transmission guaranteed at 10-second intervals for phone locked/minimized scenarios. Direct native HTTP transmission to server endpoints.
- **📱 APK COMPILATION SUCCESS**: Android APK successfully generated with BackgroundGPSService integration. All compilation errors resolved, Java dependencies satisfied, and service properly registered in AndroidManifest.
