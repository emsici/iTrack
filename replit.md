# iTrack GPS Application

## Overview
iTrack is a professional enterprise GPS monitoring application for fleet management in Romania. It provides real-time GPS tracking, trip management, robust offline capabilities, and comprehensive analytics to optimize transport operations. The project's vision is to offer a reliable and efficient solution for vehicle tracking, supporting operational excellence and market potential in the transport industry.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Date format preference: DD-MM-YYYY (zi-luna-an) for Romanian locale.
Performance optimization: Universal optimization for ALL Android phones (not device-specific).
Code comments: All comments must be in Romanian language.
Backup files: Remove unnecessary backup files (OptimalGPSService_backup.java removed).
UI Performance: Remove heavy animations (rainbow flows, floating animations, gradient shifts, pulse effects) that may affect performance on Android devices.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.6 with custom CSS featuring glassmorphism and modern animations
- **Mobile Framework**: Capacitor 7.3.0 for native cross-platform deployment (primarily Android)

### Backend Integration
- **API Communication**: RESTful API integration
- **Authentication**: JWT token with automatic persistence
- **Data Format**: JSON

### Mobile Platform Integration
- **Primary Target**: Android with native GPS services
- **Cross-Platform**: Capacitor allows iOS deployment
- **Native Services**: Enhanced GPS tracking with continuous background operation, intelligent battery management via foreground service, and WakeLock implementation.
- **Permissions**: Location, background location, and exclusion from battery optimization.

### Core Features
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Secure email/password login, JWT token management, and secure logout.
- **Advanced GPS Tracking**: Native Android service for continuous background tracking (5-second interval), offline caching of coordinates with batch synchronization, and high-precision data. Includes adaptive intervals (3s when locked, 10s when unlocked), foreground service priority, and Doze mode bypass.
- **Professional Trip Management**: Vehicle number input, loading of vehicle-specific trips, real-time status management (Available, Active, Pause, Stopped), and an optimized driver interface.
- **Enterprise Analytics**: Dedicated modals for detailed trip statistics (distance, time, speed) using the Haversine formula, and cumulative reports.
- **Advanced Debug Panel**: Accessible via 50 clicks on the timestamp, providing persistent logging (GPS, API, OFFLINE_SYNC, APP, ERROR categories) and export functions.
- **Robust Offline Management**: Automatic online/offline status detection, intelligent GPS coordinate caching, visual synchronization progress, automatic recovery, and retry logic for data transmission. Syncs in batches of 50 coordinates with chronological sorting.

### Technical Implementations
- **GPS Logic**: OptimalGPSService runs persistently in the background, acquiring WakeLock for deep sleep prevention. Redundant GPS services ensure transmission even if native Android GPS is unavailable. SharedTimestampService for cross-service consistency.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Corporate design with glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and intuitive iconography. Responsive layouts with safe area padding. Optimized for zero-lag scrolling by eliminating `backdrop-filter`, `blur` effects, and `transform` properties.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging, non-blocking GPS operations, graceful degradation for network issues, and clear user guidance for permissions.
- **Environment Management**: Centralized API_CONFIG system for easy environment switching (PROD/TEST/DEV) with automated build scripts (`start.bat`/`start.sh`).
